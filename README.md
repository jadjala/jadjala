### 🧠 About Me
I'm a passionate BSIS student who believes in *learning by doing*.  
I enjoy working on projects that challenge how I think — from full-stack systems to decentralized apps.  
I’m fascinated by how Web3, design, and data can shape real-world impact when used right.  

Outside of coding, I’m either watching K-Dramas with my family, playing games, or singing (alone… mostly 😂).  
I value sincerity, consistency, and the drive to grow — both in code and in character.
